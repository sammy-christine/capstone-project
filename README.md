# IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance

## üìä Dataset Overview

This dataset is provided by IBM and is widely used for analytics and predictive modeling in human resources. It includes various attributes related to employees' personal and professional details, with the goal of predicting employee attrition (i.e., whether or not an employee will leave the company).

- **Source**: [Kaggle - IBM HR Analytics Attrition Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)
- **Context**: Employee attrition is a major problem for many companies. Understanding why employees leave and identifying factors that contribute to attrition is essential for improving employee retention and business performance.
- **Rows**: 1,470
- **Columns**: 35
